# FlexiConc: Reading Concordances with Algorithms

Tutorial at the [Konvens 2025 conference](https://konvens-2025.hs-hannover.de/program/#flexiconc-reading-concordances-with-algorithms), 9 September 2025, Hildesheim, Germany.

> Concordance analysis is a central technique in corpus linguistics, computational lexicography, discourse analysis, digital humanities, and other fields. In this tutorial, we show how concordance reading can be supported with well-established as well as innovative computational algorithms. We present FlexiConc, a Python library developed specifically for this purpose which works with concordance data from various corpus tools (including CWB, Sketch Engine, KorAP, and CLiC). Following a theoretical introduction to the principles and five key strategies of concordance reading, we introduce a general mathematical framework for algorithms organised around the five strategies, as well as our approach to comprehensive research documentation in terms of analysis trees. We also discuss the practical implementation of FlexiConc, its integration with host apps, and the challenges we have faced. The last part of the tutorial is a hands-on session showing how to use FlexiConc in a Jupyter Notebook environment, which enables a tight integration of quantitative and qualitative approaches. Drawing on worked examples from multiple subfields, including lexicography and literary stylistics, we demonstrate how reproducible concordance analysis can inform and enrich linguistic research. Participants are encouraged to bring their own laptops and install FlexiConc, but can also work with Google Colab notebooks.
